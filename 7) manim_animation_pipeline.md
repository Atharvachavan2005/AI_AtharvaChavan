2Manim animation pipeline:

LLM returns a compact Manim script skeleton (scene names, objects to animate, short animation instructions).

Validate and sanitize LLM script (very important for execution safety).

Execute Manim locally or in a CI container to render video files (.mp4).

Short Manim skeleton (example output LLM could give):

# Example saved as manim_scene.py
from manim import *

class ArrayIntro(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        arr = Square().scale(0.5)
        # ... LLM-provided steps: build visual boxes, animate insert/remove, add labels
        self.play(Write(Text("Array: contiguous memory")))

# run: manim -pql manim_scene.py ArrayIntro
# Example saved as manim_scene.py
from manim import *

class ArrayIntro(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        arr = Square().scale(0.5)
        # ... LLM-provided steps: build visual boxes, animate insert/remove, add labels
        self.play(Write(Text("Array: contiguous memory")))

# run: manim -pql manim_scene.py ArrayIntro




Why this stack?

all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for embeddings = cheap, fast, good quality for retrieval and easy self-host.

+1

FAISS or other vector DB = fast kNN and trivial to host. 
Milvus

GPT-4.x family = best practical combination of reasoning + long context in many production RAG uses; reduces need for heavy prompt-engineering when fed good context. 
Databricks
+1

python-pptx + Manim = programmatic, reproducible slide + animation generation; both widely used and easy to integrate with CI.
